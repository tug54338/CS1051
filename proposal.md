# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

"Ultimate Tetris"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game of Tetris with new blocks added and/or a bigger arena.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using Pygame, "Ultimate Tetris" will be coded in Python. Similar to the original game of Tetris, randomized blocks will be sent down and the player must have a complete layer of blocks for it to disappear. In addition, the arena will be expanded and new blocks will be implemented that differ from the original.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Brian Truong, tul24693@temple.edu, Joanne Nichols

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The creation of the arena and generating blocks that are able to stack on top of one another.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Generating randomly shaped and colored blocks and establishing win conditions of the game.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The entirety of Tetris such as the randomized colored blocks as well as adjusting the speed of the game. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn how to operate Pygame. I will need to research on how to develop games such as how to create the basic arena of Tetris as well as the generation of various blocks. I will be working on the graphical aspects of the game while my partner will be working on the physics of the game. Overall, we will be helping each other for all parts of the project.
